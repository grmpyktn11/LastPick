# INSTALL DEPENDANCIES
    to install, simply enter pip install -r requirements.txt

# login and registration:
     You can register for an account stored in a database (hosted with clever cloud because jts free :3).
     You sign up with a username, and add your list of champions

 # Check matchup
      Enter your lane, and the champion you're playing against.
      It will use a scraper to pull the top 3 best matchups from OP.gg
      (Op.gg was used because riot doesn't share winrates)
      If you are logged in, it will recommend one of your champs from your pool (pulled from the database)
      
# Further changes (TODO)
     Adding a settings feature which let's you change mains
